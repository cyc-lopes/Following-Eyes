# Following Eyes

## This is a simple program where the eyes on the screen follow your mouse movement. 

In order to run this program on your machine, you will need to click the green "CODE" button above the files, download the zip, extract all the files, and drag the HTML file onto your browser in a new tab. Once it's loaded, just move your mouse around on the screen and watch the eyes follow your every move.

Some future improvements to this program include:

- More complex eyes
- Displaying the mouse as an object
- Making this program into a more complex animation, where the mouse is displayed as an insect, with a pair of frog eyes watching eagerly.
